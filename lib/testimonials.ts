We are so pleased with the outcome. The folks with Pristine Clean were kind, professional, and quick. The estimate and invoicing process were seamless and easy. The quality of work was superb and the price was fair. I would absolutely recommend this company.",

It certainly was NOT for Seth and his crew. We got an appointment fast. They were very easy to communicate with. They were professional and worked with all new technology cleaning equipment. We got a great price. The crew showed up on time and left my house exactly how they promiseâ€¦. Looking PRISTINE. We are already on his books for the next cleaning. I give this company five stars and would recommend them to all.",

Pristine Clean was able to accommodate us when we need to reschedule last-minute and got our property looking ten times better than it ever did after our futile attempts to pressure wash.
